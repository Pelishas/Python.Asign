# ssignment 1: Design Your Own Class! üèóÔ∏è
# Create a class representing anything you like (a Smartphone, Book, or even a Superhero!).
# Add attributes and methods to bring the class to life!
# Use constructors to initialize each object with unique values.
# Add an inheritance layer to explore polymorphism or encapsulation.
# Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge! üé≠
